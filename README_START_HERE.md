- ✅ **Prometheus metrics** (observable)
- ✅ **Docker containers** (<2GB images)
- ✅ **docker-compose** setup (multi-service)
- ✅ **Complete test suite** (>85% coverage)

## 📋 The 4 Prompts (90 Minutes Total)

All prompts are in `copy_paste_prompts.md`:

| Prompt | Creates | Time | What You Get |
|--------|---------|------|--------------|
| **System Message** | AI Context | 0 min | Sets vibecoding standards |
| **PROMPT 1** | RTMDet + Redis + Config | 20-30 min | Fast detector + distributed cache |
| **PROMPT 2** | Kafka + Metrics + Health | 20-30 min | Event streaming + monitoring |
| **PROMPT 3** | Docker + Compose | 15-20 min | Containerization + orchestration |
| **PROMPT 4** | Test Suite | 15-20 min | >85% coverage tests |

## 🛠️ What Vibecoding Generates

Each prompt generates **production-grade code** with:

- ✅ **100% type hints** on all functions
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling**
- ✅ **Detailed logging** (structured)
- ✅ **Unit + integration tests**
- ✅ **Configuration management**
- ✅ **Documentation** (docstrings, README)

**No manual cleanup needed.** Just copy, paste, generate, and verify.

## 💡 Vibecoding Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- **Copy prompts exactly** as written
- **Verify generated code** compiles
- **Run tests** after each prompt
- **Commit after each prompt** (git)
- **Ask AI to fix** if something breaks

### ❌ DON'T:
- Modify prompts significantly
- Skip testing steps
- Generate all prompts at once without testing
- Ignore type errors or linter warnings
- Manual cleanup (ask AI to fix instead)

## 🔥 Your Current System

Based on your workspace, you currently have:

```
Current FESS:
├── YOLOv8n detector (yolov8n.pt)
├── Face recognition (known_faces/)
├── Telegram alerts
├── GUI interface (customtkinter)
├── Requirements: opencv, ultralytics, face_recognition
└── Single camera support
```

### Phase 1 Adds:
```
New Architecture:
├── RTMDet detector (4x faster)
├── Redis distributed cache (90% CPU reduction)
├── Kafka event streaming (cloud-ready)
├── Prometheus metrics (observable)
├── Docker containers (<2GB)
├── docker-compose (multi-service)
├── Test suite (>85% coverage)
└── 10+ camera support (300 FPS)
```

Your existing face recognition and Telegram features **will be preserved** and enhanced.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "AI generated code with errors"
- ✅ **Copy the error** → paste back to AI → ask to fix
- ✅ **Re-run the prompt** with error context

### "Redis/Kafka connection failed"
- ✅ Ensure docker-compose services are running
- ✅ Check `docker-compose ps`
- ✅ View logs: `docker-compose logs redis`

### "Tests failing"
- ✅ Ask AI to fix the specific test
- ✅ Ensure dependencies installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- ✅ Check Python version (3.10+)

### "Prompts taking too long"
- ✅ Normal for first-time generation (20-30 min per prompt)
- ✅ AI needs time to generate quality code
- ✅ Don't interrupt - let it complete
